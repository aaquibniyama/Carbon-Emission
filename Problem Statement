PROBLEM STATEMENT:

PROBLEM DEFINITION:
     The Problem says us to develop an system to calculate the carbon footprints  generated  by an institution in a month.
     Carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of the activities of a particular individual, organization, or community.

INPUT SPECIFICATIONS: 
1.	Amount of electricity consumption.
2.	Total amount of electricity generated from mains.
3.	Total amount of renewable electricity generated.
4.	Amount of paper consumption.
5.	Total amount of papers used.
6.	Total amount of recycle papers used.
7.	Amount of papers which goes under the process of recycling.
8.	Amount of waste generated.
9.	Total amount of dry waste generated.
10.	Total amount of wet waste generated.
11.	Do all dry waste is sent for recycling?

OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS:
1.	Total amount of paper which is not recycled
2.	Total amount of waste which is not recycled
3.	Total amount of electricity which is generated from the non renewable sources
4.	Total amount of carbon footprints generated by the institution 
5.	Methods which can be implied to reduce the carbon footprints 

SPECIAL  SPECIFICATIONS:
1.	All the quantities which should be specified by the user must have a standard unit .
2.	The time period for which the data is collected should be mentioned.
3.	Methods suggested  for reducing carbon footprints must be fesible with the institution 
4.	The methods should be such that  it can be applied within the institution to reduce the carbon footprints
